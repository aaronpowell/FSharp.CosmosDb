**This release has breaking changes from pre-v1**

### Changed

- Moved away from `Azure.Cosmos` 'V4' SDK to use `Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos` 'V3' SDK
  - v4 has no GA date and new features land in v3
- No longer using `AsyncPagable` or `Page<T>` as that was in v4
- `execBatchAsync` now accepts a batch size so it can properly paginate
- Updated analyzer dependencies
- The record representing a connection to Cosmos is now a disposable object
- Upgraded .NET 6

### Added

- New APIs for getting the raw SDK version of the CosmosClient, Database and Container
- New API for working with the Cosmos Change Feed in a F# manner
- Sample showing how to use the Change Feed, works with the existing sample but can be run standalone
- New `Cosmos.dispose` method for disposing of a connection (just wraps the call on `ConnectionOperation` for disposable)
